# ProductivePets
A tool to make completing tasks fun with a personal, interactive pet that responds to task completion.

Project ideas:
1. Users are given a pet with a health bar/some form of stats.
2. Users input their tasks---daily, weekly, long-term.
3. When users complete a task, they are given coins to use in the virtual shop (to buy things for their pet).
4. If users don't complete their tasks or complete them late, then they will not be able to buy pet food from the shop, increasing their pet's hunger stat.
5. If a pet is hungry for too long, it will continuously take damage over a time period.
6. If a pet loses all of its health, it will die, and the user will have to restart with a new pet.
7. Potentially include mini games inside of the project that supplement the caretaker aspect:
   - Taking the pet for a walk.
   - Grooming the pet.

Different branches of the project:
1. Widgets on MacOS homescreen.
2. Pet display in the status menus (MacOS).
3. Widgets on iOS homescreen and widget center.
4. Website for Android and Windows users.

Project tools:
1. Xcode.
2. Swift.
